I made that man,
Not that,
I met him,
I have no more to say,
It wasn’t long enough to get hold of,
Oh, he doesn’t care about her,
And now,
It is my heart,
If you wish to change the subject, pray do,
Look here,
It will be a most agreeable mode of passing the time,
Let’s try another,
A very proper letter,
This,
There is still time to draw back,
A disgusting letter,
Not at all,
That,
Yes, it’s 500,
Naturally,
O, just a bit of it,
Entirely,
She tried to catch him herself,
I thought you were a gentleman,
Contained in a friend’s letter,
It must have been as painful for her to write as for me to read,
I have that pleasure,
I do not think that is necessary,
That is, of course, enough,
A pearl ornament,
A pearl heart,
Mere badinage,
In execrably bad taste,
It is the same thing,
I should have thought there was a distinction,
It was at the beginning,
It is not probable,
I may catch a glimpse of her in her carriage from the top of my ‘bus,
Yes,
I’ve seen your mother,
On reflection,
That’s all very well for you,
I hope you’ll enjoy yourselves,
Never you mind, little woman,
Lord forgive us, cinders, ashes, dust,
You’re right,
It’s only in stories that people are in love when they marry,
Yes, and then it’s generally with somebody else,
Yes,
Let’s talk about something else,
I believe you’re humbuggin’ me,
I am offering a veiled apology,
Or anybody else,
I’m not fit to die,
I don’t care a pin for your opinion, you know,
Of course,
Nobody would,
He lives in town, you know,
They mostly do--and write about the country,
He’s awfully clever, you know,
O, no,
Yes, that’s him,
No,
I’ll get out here,
Goodbye,
I didn’t know you were back,
I agree,
Of course it’s nice to be one of the family,
The cat is that,
This becomes interesting,
Start quite afresh,
No one better,
It is but good manners,
Leave that fellow out,
Of course,
She can’t have any,
I’ve thought it all over very carefully,
Give it time to sink in,
Oh, it’s no good taking your case,
Some of them were before,
Archie will be in soon,
It seems to me,
She came last,
One never knows,
I shall find out for myself,
Now mind,
Come along,
It might have been the fiddle,
I do hope you agree with me,
Men and women,
Yes,
What we have to do,
Just so,
Get their marching orders,
O, yes,
I do not bribe,
Quite right,
I was not joking,
I see you’re right,
To throw away our true weapons,
Is a reform of the upper classes,
They should,
I thought we agreed really,
I’m sure we do,
He’s a traitor to his class,
It’s revolting to think of,
No,
I wonder,
Yes,
Hard on a thousand,
I wasn’t deceived,
I can’t see any,
I’m going to surprise you,
That was his guile,
Never saw a man less penitent,
I don’t believe it,
No one better,
Come,
Hilary agreed with him,
Precisely,
Glad to get him away, perhaps,
Thou art the woman,
Johnny had his code,
I must have my little amusements,
It’s nearly his time,
I’ve a good mind not to shake hands with you,
That poor old mother of his,
Hilary knows the address,
Goodbye,
Goodbye,
Yes,
Oh, yes,
Dear me, no,
Of course,
Send him that--don’t tell him,
Please do,
Oh, there were not many of the aristocracy present,
It is a very hasty conclusion,
Absurd as the supposition is,
I don’t think that’s likely,
I am deeply pained,
I was sure you’d forgive my little deception,
I should never have thought it of you,
I didn’t know your friend was there at all,
Oh, please don’t shuffle like that,
I hope we shall see you again some day,
Pray, spare me,
I have a great many people coming already,
I can take a hint,
I wish you’d take warning,
I will take my leave,
Do you mean to leave me nothing in the world,
Oh, do tell me,
I am just debating,
Of course,
She is apt,
Oh, yes, she’s handsome,
It comes to this,
Because,
It is a privilege,
But,
Then,
To hear you talk,
Now,
I was on the pier,
Blue serge,
Yes, blue serge,
Stop a minute,
Well, we were both always on the pier,
I’m glad it was no worse,
Yes,
How lovely,
And do you remember,
I remember,
Your mother was a brick,
I remember,
Yes,
Not bad little rooms,
How awfully lovely,
No,
They fell in love with her on the spot,
I do not know,
It was,
Mother was such a dear,
It was a perfect time,
I wonder why in the world you told me about it,
The only possible excuse for an engagement like that,
Your embroidery’s falling on the floor,
Not a bit of it,
Yes, it is,
Then we don’t excuse it,
It’s nearly eleven. We’ve spent half-an-hour on the thing,
I hope you won’t think all love affairs are like that,
Awfully sorry, old chap,
Don’t try that on me,
She did look ripping in that white frock,
Stop,
Good night,
No,
Uninteresting,
Sam, old boy,
I don’t know what else you expect at your age,
Then,
Still, you know,
That appears to me to be a paradox,
It’s precious hard to explain it to you if you’ve never felt it,
I shouldn’t think of contradicting you, my dear fellow,
Let’s sit down,
So we may,
A fellow,
But,
It may,
Perhaps not,
Very likely the explanation lies in that fact,
I didn’t mean you, old chap,
Oh, all right, all right,
That seems to me not to be a healthy condition,
I should certainly have supposed so,
You’re sure,
Then you’ll see,
She has an extremely prepossessing appearance,
There isn’t,
Ample, in my opinion,
They’ve gone to a party, they won’t come round again,
She gives a good many parties,
I mean, how awfully interesting,
It’s no use telling him anything. He can’t understand,
Sam’s seen her,
She is just,
I am a kind old thing,
One can never tell,
Oh, you needn’t smile in that infernally patronizing way,
It’s the very latest thing,
I wish it had been a little later still,
It would be extremely interesting to read them,
Oh! but they’re quite confidential,
I don’t appreciate that part,
Perhaps you will when you’ve written yours,
I hope not,
Not a bit,
I hate sentiment,
By the way,
He has never asked to see them,
You promise to be sincere, you know,
Yes,
Then you needn’t write it quite all down,
I am obliged,
Now read it,
It is, on the whole,
No, really,
That’s a different thing,
I don’t quite understand that,
It is surely simple,
Of course,
That really is nice,
Thank you,
While,
She thinks,
You put that very nicely,
It explains itself,
Are unanimous,
My mental powers are not despicable,
I have said so,
N-no,
To correct the mistake,
I’m afraid so,
The other was nonsense,
Oh, utter nonsense,
To have a quiet smoke,
Yes, alone,
But,
It’s so bad for him,
How human the creatures are,
Do you know,
Your extravagance,
Of course,
Economy,
Oh, dear, no,
I have made a discovery lately,
You’re not meant to hear,
He’s made a good many lately,
Don’t be so allegorical,
Oh, yes, let’s,
No,
It is simple,
The discovery,
You are middle-aged,
So will you be soon,
Not soon,
Some day,
You will become,
You’re very disagreeable today,
Pereunt et imputantur,
A trite, but offensive, assertion,
I like that one,
It’s very sensible,
Some people measure everything,
I think it is rather horrid,
Why, it isn’t even true,
Well, you have a shot,
The oysters are eaten and put down in the bill,
Well, somebody’s got to pay,
Oh, yes, somebody,
It’s not always a chap,
Well, then the individual,
It doesn’t say so,
Oh, come, you don’t gammon me,
Well, it does you know,
It is,
Read it out,
I wonder,
I shouldn’t be at all surprised,
I’m so sorry when you do that,
I really am,
Certainly not,
That would be rather strict,
It’s just to teach them the ordinary things,
It is a comprehensive curriculum,
Fourteen and sixteen,
It is a pity,
The governess and myself, to be sure,
And under the apple tree,
One thing and another,
Not at all,
She’ll have got over any nonsense by then,
She had remarkably pretty hair,
One’s first love,
But you don’t seem to have been happy,
She ought to be a person of active habits,
And an early riser,
The sect makes no difference,
You may as well post this for me,
That won’t amuse her much,
She’s not coming to be amused,
Thank you,
I don’t know,
Guess,
Oh, no; not fat,
I am undoubtedly bald,
You’re certainly bald,
You said you would,
Who knows,
It was the very first,
Tell her,
I shall do no such thing,
And tell her,
I shan’t say a word about you,
Ah, well, that will be better still,
She’ll have forgotten your very name,
I see nothing whatever to laugh at,
I did not ask you to laugh,
It’s not typical,
I’m not surprised either,
A book,
I’ve got to go up tomorrow,
D----d hole,
One of the best fellows alive,
I wonder why she married him, though,
It’s nothing. Don’t be a fool,
All is well,
You’re an awful ass sometimes,
Anything, you old idiot,
Beg your pardon, sir,
Yes, sir,
But very short,
Get in and drive round,
I can’t,
The joint is injured,
Oh, no, you’re not my husband,
I’m ashamed of you,
Oh, please do,
You give them roses,
She was a pudding-faced thing,
He’s a nice boy,
I am a long way past that,
It’s miles from my club,
He’s such fun,
He said the same about the pudding-faced girl,
The carriage exercise is doing it good,
If,
A wise man,
He’ll remember two days later,
Stop the carriage,
I won’t stop the carriage,
I am at a premium today,
One must have something,
It would do it good,
His father gave him,
And very liberal too,
It depends where you dine,
Certainly the competitors are horses,
Oh, well,
And even that,
Most of us have grossly deceived our parents before now,
I hope you’re speaking for your own sex,
Not more than yours,
I hate quibbles,
Now,
Oh, let the poor child alone, anyhow,
Yes, once,
Out with it,
It only happened last summer,
Still,
We must have the story,
I was very naughty,
I know that age,
And a young man in it,
No girls’ school can keep up its numbers without one,
Well, there was, anyhow,
Precisely,
No, a shilling,
I don’t mind going on,
The other girls are always easy to lose,
The young dog,
Nothing, nothing,
But we found the confectioner’s,
He had no money at all,
Yes,
Details, please,
It all ends most satisfactorily,
I wonder,
I’m not going to tell you anything more,
It did happen at the door,
I hope,
I shall have to keep my eye on her,
You can’t do it,
There’s not the least likeness,
I am very angry with you,
I haven’t the least notion of what you mean,
Ah,
Well,
No, don’t my dear,
It will be dull enough, anyhow,
Bourgeois,
But it’s not a nice thing to be, all the same,
You’re in no danger of it,
Just by the depth of your dimples,
I thought,
There was an election in our division that year,
Oh, then, it doesn’t count,
The day you were buried,
I was afraid you weren’t a bit sincere,
Well, judge by yourself,
It was incomparably the most artistic thing to do,
That chances to remain in my memory,
I’ve always thought it kind of you never to speak of it,
It is best forgotten,
We should have said the same about anybody,
Certainly. We were only trying to be smart,
Really we were not to blame,
A strange whirligig, no doubt,
He shouldn’t have worn such clothes,
It was all the clothes,
That was very absurd of you,
It was certainly unreasonable of us,
But we scouted the idea of it,
It was a most curious mistake to make,
O, well, it’s put right now,
That was a terrible moment,
I said he was--ugly,
She saw it in a minute,
There is a touch now and then,
I don’t altogether wonder at that,
Conversing confidentially,
Just one week later,
I’ve seen the piece twice,
I’ve seen some things much oftener,
I don’t want my girl to be too nice,
She shall be pretty,
I am unreasonable,
Sometimes you are,
On the contrary,
Yes, he does,
It’s not so bad--licking the glass,
Go and change it, if you love me,
You look hideous in it,
I could wish,
It took just a week,
I don’t ask you for more than a guinea,
It would be the same,
Yes,
I was in a mad mood today,
Above all, to be good girls,
Nothing,
I should like,
Hope,
Oh, don’t be hasty,
That settles it,
I wonder if you’ll behave properly,
You mean he won’t,
He has always been prevented hitherto,
It would be a privilege,
I assure you,
Not at all, not at all,
Only seeing her here,
It happens to be more hers than mine,
Nothing could justify it,
Do not let us blame her,
I suppose,
Unless you want me,
I’m so busy next week--come the week after,
That’s very unkind,
I won’t surprise you,
Of course not,
I’d much rather come with you,
We’ll have a cozy drive all to ourselves,
I did my best to make it so,
You are right,
My husband’s not unkind,
I didn’t mean your husband,
But you’d probably be very dull,
Perhaps it’s all for the best,
Young man,
There are some things one can’t stick to,
By the merest chance,
I went to three,
I might not have gone,
I can’t see what difference it would have made if you hadn’t,
I fell in love,
Men of your age,
I was not thinking of it,
You seem very pleased with yourself,
Yes, take care of your complexion,
I am very pleased with myself,
I was,
She liked me very much,
It would have gone better without saying,
I’ll come to the wedding,
There won’t be a wedding,
That,
It’s very curious,
It would be very curious,
He won’t die,
I hate that sort of superstition,
He certainly won’t die,
I hope the poor man won’t die,
No, no,
No one,
You’ve had none there for ten years,
I did not mean my forehead,
I don’t think,
They would,
You fail to allow,
Of paying you pronounced attentions,
That,
It would be the finest testimonial to her,
I shall go through the evening,
Her husband,
It’s not quite fair,
It’s a grand world,
You’re not really old,
Gradually and disgracefully,
I am going to another party tonight,
I am a very fortunate fellow,
There is,
I shall get there about eleven,
Oh, yes, you would, dear,
Nemo omnibus horis sapit,
Nemo--everybody,
Not quite that,
THEY,
The antithesis is certainly imperfect,
It is true,
I don’t think he meant it quite in that sense,
I don’t think he meant it in any sense,
And half are on one side, and half on the other,
I think they looked better on the other side, after all,
Of course you do,
Perhaps you’d like to move them back,
No,
It was,
I must confess it,
I’m sure of that,
Well, then, to put it plainly,
I really thought you understood,
I thought,
She thought so too,
As a matter of fact,
We might as well go in to lunch,
By all means,
I want my lunch,
More pots,
Till you tell the truth,
I’m going to carry the pots,
Come along, you two,
I’m going in to lunch,
Ask them to keep some for me,
It’s most unfair,
I don’t care if it is,
It’s no use trying to deceive me,
Any formalities which are usual,
I was a mere boy,
A man must be somewhere,
I should have wasted the money anyhow,
I suppose you would,
I am disappointed,
We have our rules,
It will be an extremely interesting experience,
I don’t see what that’s got to do with it,
The account runs on,
It’s not the least use,
Dear, dear,
The book’s too heavy for you to hold,
I’ll come round,
Bouquet du diable,
Poor old thing,
I must go in, you know,
I shouldn’t have thought you’d consider that conclusive,
Don’t be horrid,
This is a very painful duty,
It’s very absurd of you,
I can’t help it, though,
I do, indeed,
Really,
You’re very unkind,
Don’t do that,
It’s as much as my place is worth,
Some day,
I haven’t got a wife,
That’s why you’re so hard-hearted,
I didn’t know she was going to do it,
Oh, of course,
No,
That’s sensible,
I suppose everything will be very different here,
Defects,
