In fact you did?
Where did he wear that?
Let’s hear your method. What did you do to him?
Not a bit?
Tore his hair?
What did the fellow complain of?
But he didn’t go back to short trousers and a fiddle, did he?
Not a little bit?
Nor with any one else?
Nor with any one else?
Hullo, old chappie, where did you spring from?
Who?
Whose?
In fact, you have forgotten the evening?
Really?
You are amused?
Do you mean to cut us?
Does--does she know it all?
Didn’t you smooth it over?
Were you ever in love?
Often?
What of?
But aren’t you a person of--?
But don’t you ever want to get--?
No, he isn’t. Are you afraid?
On your honor?
Would--would other people think so?
You never met him, did you?
Why shouldn’t they?
Have--have you written any poetry lately?
O, yes, a hundred things. Have you--killed--anything lately?
Want to stay any longer?
All who?
Aren’t you accustomed to your dignity yet?
For him?
To him?
Haven’t we left out one point to view?
Quite so. Now suppose you think how it would affect them?
Who?
Why not mine as well as another?
Who was she?
Then it was before--?
Is it any use trying to remember all their names?
Do you belong?
And how much was it he stole?
Behaved all right, didn’t he?
Hilary?
Oh, but why in the world--?
Oh, and he stole for some wretched--?
Now do be careful. What do you know about the lady?
Why must she?
Didn’t you notice his attentions to any one?
Who was she?
And you dare to come and tell me?
Who knows?
Her name?
Won’t you tell me?
What for?
You don’t mean--?
How dare you torment me so?
Do you know where the little wretch has gone?
I--I suppose you don’t ever write to him?
But you--could?
Did you ever hear anything more atrocious?
How do you know she was flirting?
Why do you call him ‘poor man’?
Oh, never mind. Did he tell you?
Well, what are you going to say?
Is it any good talking about it now?
Well?
It is goodbye?
As if it was my fault?
Why are you looking at me?
Do you like doing it?
Do you always work the same pattern?
What morning?
Do mermaids wear white serge?
And is that all?
You never quarreled, or broke it off?
Nobody came between you?
Hilary’s people made themselves nasty, perhaps?
Surely it’s quite early, old man?
I say, old man, weren’t you ever that way yourself?
What?
Never?
No. Are you?
How very peculiar?
Oh, you’ve mentioned it to him?
Who, indeed?
Is she very--?
Not altogether bad-looking, either, is she?
Why above all?
Do you think as badly of me as all that?
You would not have had me disagreeable?
I suppose you mean that to be nice?
How do you know that?
I beg your pardon?
Is there anything wrong?
Do you really think so?
Alone?
Isn’t that clever?
What are you two talking about?
Shall we walk on the terrace?
Well, what is it?
What do the mottoes mean?
But what does it mean?
What does it matter?
And what’s that?
What is it?
What are the ordinary things?
Who used to meet?
What about?
How old was she?
And the governess?
Have you ever seen her since?
Is she what mamma wants?
F-forty-three--oh, or forty-two?
Should you call me fat?
Another?
It’s your own fault. Why did you introduce him?
Where did you get that rose?
This rose?
What the deuce are you laughing at?
And term lasts two months?
Must you go?
Talk about what?
What’s the matter with your nose?
Would you like to get out?
How is your nose?
Would afternoon tea hurt it?
A horse race?
Haven’t you?
How did you know that?
The shilling?
Was it still foggy?
Now what did he--?
Yes, didn’t it?
How should you describe me, then?
Did we ever?
On a bench. You remember the bench?
Not the bench?
That what were?
What we were--? Oh, to be sure, the--the blemishes?
Do you remember the dreadful thing that happened the same evening?
Oh, but doesn’t it seem funny?
Well, what were we doing?
Well, you’ll take me to the theater?
What does he do when he’s finished it?
How are you, old chap?
Archie, what in the world are you wearing?
A quick change, eh, my boy?
I beg your pardon?
Her house?
You won’t be alone this evening?
Besides, you’d rather come with me, wouldn’t you?
Would you like to come again tomorrow?
You’re quite serious about it, aren’t you?
Do you expect to be forgiven?
Are you doing anything this evening?
Why won’t you come?
Of anything dreadful?
And you’ll spend the evening thinking of her?
What’s her husband?
Shall you?
Oh, and you mean she wouldn’t have you?
THEY?
Why did they think you impossible?
And how did you like it?
Why do you say, ‘in its way’?
Oh, you thought that?
Did she though?
Well?
Where are you going?
You don’t mean that?
Have they, really?
What’s that scent you’ve got on?
Aren’t you a fright?
Really?
Isn’t it rather too late for that sort of thing?
Oh, it’s you, is it?
