Oh, well, you didn’t then. It only looked like it.
You seem to think that very funny.
Not that he did--but that, apparently, he doesn’t.
Well, you’re so unobservant.
But she wrote me a horrid letter afterward.
You’re so very elliptical.
But he’s going to marry that girl.
Well, it is, really.
I don’t call her such a bad-looking girl, though.
Of course he does.
You might let me finish.
Archie thinks you were never in love before.
Well, go on.
Oh, there’s nothing else.
The others aren’t very interesting.
Yes. Really.
Yes, you shall go on.
starers.
I’ve been reading an unpleasant story.
None at all.
More than all--much more.
I never said it.
All right--I never did.
No.
Yes, or the bag, you know.
No, not lately.
Ah, she taught me the way out of it.
It is the first lesson of a housekeeper.
Not at all.
One of them waited to be sent for, though.
Yes--and for me. But then it doesn’t seem quite fair.
I--er--mean he knows you too well to do such a thing.
Why, the men.
I never heard of her.
Hold your tongue--and tell me what you mean.
He’d only known you three years, you see.
She plays the piano a good deal.
And which candidate to support.
Pamphlets.
Let them give an example of duty, of self-denial, of frugality.
Let them set an example of morality.
Yes. Of course there was a something.
His widowed mother was a trump, you know.
Do you mean a good woman.
Why, he always pretended to want him to be convicted.
He used to speak most strongly against him.
And he was much impressed with his bearing.
And she must have known his money wasn’t his own.
Certainly you have.
I should.
As much as you like.
If you promise.
Look in the glass.
To see your face, to be sure.
Horribly.
He ought to have been all the more angry.
Of course he ought.
Then you mustn’t have it very often.
And it is shared by so many people.
Then we got to know one another.
No.
No. It all went just perfectly. Why, of course it did.
Oh, well, hard hit, you know--a girl, you know.
You’ve not told me her name, you see.
Well, that was her.
We might see somebody else we know.
Archie’s.
There would be an end of our friendship.
Yet, if it’s a discovery, he ought to hear it.
An entirely surprising one.
The other is longer.
And better. Horas non numero nisi serenas.
I’ll write about it at once.
She left next morning.
No.
Hang it, one sees those people everywhere.
He’ll have forgotten by the end of the term.
And on the way there--oh, you know, he went to the lectures.
On the way there it became rather--rather foggy.
And he--he found me in the fog.
And left me at the door.
I’m sure it was.
the important thing is this: my parallel is obvious and complete.
I remember being in very low water more than one evening there.
Yes; you told me you were terribly hard-up.
I think you were hardly yourself.
Do be more charitable.
No.
I see. Well, you said then what you couldn’t possibly have meant.
I dare say. I often did.
Why, the--the--what we’re talking about.
Oh, well, it was a facon de parler.
And it was horribly unjust.
At us, please.
Is nothing, although we made a grievance of it at the time.
We ought have known he was a gentleman.
And then you went away.
But it wasn’t as if he’d heard what we were saying.
No; but he’d seen what we were doing.
Oh, all right.
Quite enough.
I always wanted to think well of her.
I’m going to the school again tomorrow.
You really seemed interested last time.
I thought three times about going. It’s a curious world.
I suppose you talked nonsense to her.
She was perfect.
They were. It made no difference.
You’re very rude, indeed. Many women would never speak to you again.
Ask me again on the first opportunity.
I don’t know what that means either.
But that’s the same thing.
Please don’t use all those long words.
