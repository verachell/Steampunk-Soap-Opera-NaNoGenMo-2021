There’s ingratitude for you!
Where!
What very arbitrary distinctions you draw!
Lord, no!
And it’s all due to you!
Hear, hear!
Young knave!
Stop!
Stop!
My dears!
Romping!
Goodness knows!
Lord!
What a game!
Oh, if you count that!
Stuff!
Oh!
Still with your inseparables!
How conscientious of you to inquire!
How funny that sounds!
Impossible!
That girl!
It’s false--false--false!
Oh!
Oh, the little wretch!
Or you wouldn’t have been deceived!
Hilary believed it!
Oh, all right!
What an audacious little creature!
The presumption of it!
Silly little wretch!
With you!
What fun!
How charming that would be!
Well, then!
What a row there was!
How perfectly lovely!
Dull!
Dull!
Dull!
I’m hanged if she did!
Never!
Yes. Hang it!
The--young person!
Oh, what fun!
Fun!
Dear boy!
Oh, you mustn’t look at that--not at that, above all!
Impossible!
And you had to write the truth!
Stop!
Ah!
Oh, you dear old thing!
Do you think that anybody measured the rain gauge!
No more than he did!
Oh, but that must be ages ago!
Heaven forbid!
Poor children!
Out with it!
George--George--George!
Yes, confound it!
Yes, hang it!
If you mean to be disagreeable!
How disgusting!
Blessings on it!
It’s ideal!
And a week later you went home!
My dear, dear boy, go and change it!
I wonder if you mean that!
How tiresome you are!
Half-a-crown!
I dare say you spent as much as this on wine with your lunch!
Oh, you mustn’t depreciate her--you, of all men!
O, no!
Nonsense!
Rather!
Really!
That’s just like you!
Oh, nonsense!
Oh, you might be a boy!
If he had died last night!
you cared about what was proper!
Ah!
I’m off!
Woman--woman--woman!
Woman--woman--woman!
Lunch!
Pots!
How obstinate you are!
Well, well!
Oh, you old dear!
Stop!
Oh, be off with you--both of you!
